# Webhooks reference

The Iottly platform can send notifications of messages received from connected devices to external services using webhoks.

## Manage webhooks

 You can configure webhooks for your project through the [iottly web interface](https://cloud.iottly.com).
 From your project's dashboard toggle the project settings area by clicking the
 __OPEN__ button in the top-right corner of the screen and then navigate to the 
 __"Configure webhooks"__ section.

 ![Manage webhooks page](/images/api/webhookpanel.png)

 In the "Configure webhooks" panel you can:
 - view the active webhooks for your project,
 - set-up a new webhook
 - and delete the ones that you don't use anymore

## Setup a webhook

 ![Setup a webhook](/images/api/webhookcreate.png)

 To __set-up a new webhook__ click on "Add webhook" insert the required information:
 
 ![Setup a webhook](/images/api/webhookcreatedetail.png)

 
- a human-friendly __description__ of the webhook.
- the __url__ of your service.
- the __type__ of messages that you want to deliver:
  - __iottly__: messages generated by the iottly agent.
  - __user__: message generated by the user application or management scripts.
- a **webhook channel** (string) used to filter messages based on a match with the `payload.webhook_channel` field.
- specify whether or not you want to deliver only the payload of the messages. If selected and a **webhook channel** is specified only forward `payload.webhook_payload`.
- a __list of HTTP headers__ that iottly will use when calling your service (up to 5 custom headers can be supplied).

and press "Create webhook" when your are done.

> __Note:__ Right now you can set-up up to 5 webhooks in each project

## Webhooks in action

If you have configured one or more webhooks in your project, iottly will push a notification
to the __webhook url__ you have specified each time one of the devices attached to your project generate a message.

iottly will send an __HTTP POST request__ to the provided __webhook url__ with:

- the supplied __request headers__
- the message received as the request body (in json format)
    ```json
    {
      "msg": {
        //the message received from a device attached to the project
      }
    }
    ```

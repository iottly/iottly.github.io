# Warm up exercise without IoT!

#### What you will learn in this tutorial:
- How to [Electrically switch on/off a LED](#electrically-switch-onoff-a-led)


## Preconditions
After connecting your Raspberry Pi:
- [Connect Raspberry Pi to Iottly]({{'tutorials/connect_raspberrypi' | relative_url}}){:target="_blank"}

you can follow this tutorial.

## Electrically switch on/off a LED

In this exercise we are going to use RPi to power a LED
- Create a circuit like the one in the sketch
- The push button connects the LED anode to the 3.3V (through a 220Ohm resistor)
